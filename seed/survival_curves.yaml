# Cervical Cancer Survival Curves

# Probabilities of survival where obtained from a cohort study of women with invasive cervical cancer diagnosed by a large cancer center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 1999 and 2004 (Carlo & Luiz, 2011). The survival curves are presented as functions of the stage at detection and time passed since the initial diagnosis.

# Kaplan-Meier curves were extracted from Carlo & Luiz (2011) Figure 1. We used the WebPlotDigitizer tool (available from: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~dcostine/personal/PowerDeviceLib/DigiTest/index.html) to extract the approximate data points.
